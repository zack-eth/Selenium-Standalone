Welcome to JSC â€” a minimum viable product of Java, Selenium, and Cucumber in action!  It includes a bash script for Mac / Linux, and a PowerShell script for Windows.  JSC was originally created for recruiting purposes, as the basis for a stand-alone take-home project.  That said, it may also serve as a quickstart for cross-platform web automation.

1. Run run.sh (Mac / Linux) or run.ps1 (Windows).  You should see some unit tests fail because they are not implemented.  Implement them and re-run the script until they pass.
2. Now you should see a Cucumber test fail.  Fix it and re-run the until it passes.
3. Refactor Main.java to improve the code quality.

Welcome to Selenium Standalone â€” a minimum viable product of Java, Selenium, and Cucumber in action!  It includes a bash script for Mac / Linux, and a PowerShell script for Windows.  This project was originally created for recruiting purposes, as the basis for a stand-alone take-home project.  That said, it may also serve as a quickstart for cross-platform web automation.

1. Run <a href="https://github.com/zskolnik/Selenium-Cucumber-Standalone/blob/master/script/run.sh">run.sh</a> (Mac / Linux) or <a href="https://github.com/zskolnik/Selenium-Cucumber-Standalone/blob/master/script/run.ps1">run.ps1</a> (Windows).  You should see some <a href="https://github.com/zskolnik/Selenium-Cucumber-Standalone/blob/master/test/JUnitTest.java">unit tests</a> fail because they are not implemented.  Implement them and re-run the script until they pass.
2. Now you should see a <a href="https://github.com/zskolnik/Selenium-Cucumber-Standalone/blob/master/features/Cucumber.feature">Cucumber test</a> fail.  Fix it and re-run the script until it <a href="https://github.com/zskolnik/Selenium-Cucumber-Standalone/blob/master/img/success.jpg">passes</a>.
3. Refactor <a href="https://github.com/zskolnik/Selenium-Cucumber-Standalone/blob/master/src/Main.java">Main.java</a> to improve the code quality.
